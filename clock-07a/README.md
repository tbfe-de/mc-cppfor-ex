# Code Review and Various Improvements or `UpDownCounter`

At this point a "fresh start" was made by building a `Clock` which
can count up and down.

It ios based on objects which are `UpDownCounter`-s, which
– as their name suggests – supports counting up and down too, not
only when used "stand alone" but also when "chained" together.

Intensive test code is supplied for both classes. (It may also
be useful to understand the intended use of both of the classes.)
