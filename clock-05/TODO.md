# Replace the Classic Template Method Pattern

In the next step the classic "Template Method Pattern"
from the GoF book shall be replace with a solution that
is based on C++ templates.

This is useful for comparison of the two approaches at this
moment, but unless you already have some experience with
with writing C++ templates it is suggested you just go with
a code review.
- So compare the following files:
  - `clock-05/ICounter.h`
  - to `clock-06/ICounter.h`
  - `clock-05/LimitCounter.h` and `clock-05/LimitCounter.cpp`
  - to `clock-06/LimitCounter.h`
  - `clock-05/OverflowCounter.h` and `clock-05/OverflowCounter.cpp`
  - to `clock-06/OverflowCounter.h`
